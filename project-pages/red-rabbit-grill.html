            <p>The Red Rabbit Grill is an all-ages restaurant in Rexburg, Idaho. Founded in 2017, Red Rabbit seeks to cultivate a positive and casual social environment for friends, family, and peers to meet and enjoy great food. It has largely succeeded, becoming a well-known spot in town to share significant moments at with loved ones.</p>
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>A brand was developed to refocus on what made The Red Rabbit Grill unique: The special blend of down-to-earth approachability and memory-making quality. To this end I chose to center the rough-cut wood that is on the walls of the restaurant, which perfectly encapsulates the character of Red Rabbit.
